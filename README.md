# TodoApp
A simple project to get hands on React.

I made this App as a part of my learning journey.

# Functionalities
This app contains basic functionalities like

<ul>
    <li>Adding a todo</li>
    <li>Deleting a todo</li>
    <li>Renaming a todo</li>
    <li>Marking todos as done</li>
    <li>Deleting Marked todos</li>
    <li>Showing only Marked todos</li>
</ul>

This App also stores the data related to the user in the browser, with the help of localStorage.

<b>Small description about localStorage.</b>
<br>
It is an object given provided by the Web Storage API, it allows the information in the form of key-value pairs to be stored in the web browser.
This means that if we refresh our tab, close our tabs, close our browser or even shutdown the system our data (Todos in this case with their status) will be saved.
